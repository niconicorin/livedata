{"title":"New Footprint Feature Based on Popular Request is Live Now! ","content":"<p align=\"justify\">Based on popular demand by OxyAnime fans, we have added the footprint feature.  The feature can be found at bottom of OxyAnime homepage. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This feature will record up to 20 recent streamed anime at local. Which mean you can trace your recent streamed anime up to 20 records even without sync with MyAnimeList (MAL) bookmark system. Not only that, with this feature, you may also continue streaming your previously streamed anime easily with just scroll down at OxyAnime homepage on your next visit. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">This footprint feature is set to on by default. You may also turn it off at footer of OxyAnime page if you don’t need it. After you turn it off, it won’t record any of your recent streamed anime until you turn it on again. </p>\n<p align=\"justify\">Last but not least, thank you for all OxyAnime fans suggesting such a brilliant feature. If you have any suggestion to improve our page can always let us know through the “Suggestion” tab at footer of our page. </p>\n<br><br>\n<p>Follow us :</p>\n<i class=\"fa fa-twitter w3-text-blue w3-xxxlarge\"></i> <a href=\"https://twitter.com/OxyAnime\" target=\"_blank\">https://twitter.com/OxyAnime</a>\n<br><br>\n<i class=\"fa fa-facebook-square w3-text-white w3-xxxlarge\"></i> <a href=\"https://facebook.com/OxyAnime\" target=\"_blank\">https://facebook.com/OxyAnime</a>\n<br><br>\n<i class=\"fa fa-telegram w3-text-blue w3-xxxlarge w3-white w3-round-xxlarge\"></i> <a href=\"https://t.me/+Zw3EfnXHO0UxYjU1\" target=\"_blank\">https://t.me/+Zw3EfnXHO0UxYjU1</a>\n<br><br>\n<p>19/6/2022</p>"}
